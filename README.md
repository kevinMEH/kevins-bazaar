# Kevin's Bazaar

Hello, and welcome to Kevin's Bazaar!

Kevin's Bazaar is a sample e-commerce website I created to practice and develop my frontend and backend skills, as well as experience what it feels like to develop a "real" website.

Kevin's Bazaar is made using React JS and Tailwind CSS, and serves products via a REST API from an Express JS and MongoDB backend.
